# image_process_api

Students will be designing an API for image processing that
allows the user to visit a url and using url parameters, resize
the image based on the parameters provided. Upon viewing
an image thatâ€™s already been resized, a cached image will be
served. This is the core functionality seen in placeholder image
websites and can be implemented with a frontend to better
serve appropriately sized images. The API presents the first
opportunity to pull together the technologies of the course and
tie them together in a commonly used application.
